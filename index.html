# Go A Perspective
### Presented by Gabor Liptak

# Agenda

1. Introduction

# What can you expect from this presentation?

I will offer highlights of Go features anchoring them onto other languages like
C, Java, Python, etc.

About me: I work as an architect, using Java, Python day-to-day
and used and/or studied C/C++, Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell, Go and other programming languages

About you: You bring coding background and your questions. Those with Go background,
please offer suggestions on how this presentation can be improved

# Obligatory Hello World!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	str := "Hello, 世界"
	fmt.Println(str)
}
```

# A better C(++) (!?)

Project initiated in 2007, open sourced in 2009

# Highlights

* General purpose
* Made to Top 10 Repository Languages on Github https://octoverse.github.com/ http://githut.info/
* Development happens in the open (mailing lists, Github)
* Pragmatic and expressive feature choices
* Orthogonal language features (principle of least surprise)
* Standard library (batteries included, in particular crypto)
* Compact language (25 reserved keywords)
* Garbage collected
* Statically typed
* Type-safe and memory safe (unless unsafe package is used)
* Concurrency built into the language
* Simple syntax (no semicolons in particular, curly braces required for if/for)
* Object (but not type) oriented (see interfaces)
* Compile efficiently at scale, no transitive dependency loading
* Statically linked (while fat binaries, single artifact to worry about)
* De facto formatting (with tabs :) ) using gofmt (also used as API updater gofix)
* Exception handling

???
30 keywords for C

# Another Example

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"fmt"
)

func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	p := r.URL.Path[1:]
	if len(p) == 0 {
		p = "root"
	}
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, loading %s!", p)
}

func monkey(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello Monkey!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", hello)
	http.HandleFunc("/monkey", monkey)
	http.ListenAndServeTLS(":10443", "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil)
}
```

# Built-in types

* bool
* int/uint (8/16/32/64)
* float (32/64)
* complex (64/128)
* string
* array/slice
* struct
* pointer
* function
* interface
* map
* channel

???
Note sizes, and also map, function and channel as built-ins

---

# Named types

* Let the compiler tell you that parameters were mixed up

[namedtype1.go](namedtype1.go)

???
Not frequently highlighted

---

# Closures

* Similar to most modern languages

[fibonacci1.go](fibonacci1.go)

---

# Interfaces

* If a type implements all methods of an interface, then it implements the interface
* There is no hierarchy of interfaces
* Interfaces are often introduced during codebase refactoring

```go
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
* All types implement the empty interface (interface{})
* Methods can be implemented on any type (including built-in types)

???
No implements like in Java
Think "monkey-patching" in Ruby

---

# Reflection

Type information is available and can be queried runtime

---

# Testing

The ```go test``` command will look for any tests in any of the files in the current folder and run them.

```go
func TestAddition(t *testing.T)
```
[sample1_test.go](sample1_test.go)

# Go Routines and Channels

* A go call turns a function (closure) invocation into a goroutine
* Channels support concurrent processing using message passing (like Joe Armstrong's Erlang metaphor)
* Channels are shared memory FIFO queues with syncronized operations (buffered or unbuffered)
* For a lot of simple goroutines, the 4 kB stack is probably more than necessary, which means you can run
hundreds of thousands of go routines on desktop hardware (although worker pools might be the preferred
approach in most cases). Contrast this to C threads, where 64 kB is a tiny stack and 1-4 MB is more common.

???
Discuss Unix fork, Actors (Erlang in particular, immutable messages), Java threads, Python asyncio/coroutines

# Go Routines

# Mutexes

* Channel best used for
    * Passing ownership of data
    * Distributing units of work
    * Communicating async results
* Mutexes best used for
    * Caches
    * State
* Don't be afraid to switch paradigms
* Data race detector

[race1.go](race1.go)

---

# Go Routines Select and Timeout

* Select multiplexes channels (including timeout "pseudo" channels)
* This is built-in into the language

[timeout1.go](timeout1.go)

---

# Exception handling

* panic (think throw runtime error)
* recover (catch)
* defer (function scoped finally)

# Packages / Build Times

Package names based on folder names.
Of course, if you are building from scratch and package A imports B which imports C, then of course C has to be compiled first, and then B, and then A.
The import point is that when you go to compile A, you don’t reload C’s object file.
In a real program, the dependencies are usually not a chain like this. We might have A1, A2, A3, and so on all importing B.
It’s a significant win if none of them need to reread C.
???
Folder names are package names like in Java
